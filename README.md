     - https://rpubs.com/rsaidi/1000514

## Unit 4 - Data Ethics, P-Hacking, Reproducibility, and Data Journalism
This unit will dig deep into data ethics and the reproducibility crisis.

- Use these notes to get started: [**Unit 4 Notes - Data Ethics, P-Hacking, Reproducibility, and Data Journalism**](./Data110_unit4.pdf)
- Use this Quarto document on data journalism. You will also need to access the pfizer and fda datasets from the course datasets:
     - [Data Journalism](./data_journalism.qmd)
- Use this tutorial to learn how to use Tableau Public to explore demographics in Montgomery County
   - [Montgomery County Tableau Tutorial](./MoCo_High_School_Tableau_Tutorial.pdf)

## Unit 5 - Treemaps, Heatmaps, Streamgraphs, and Alluvials
This unit will explore more complex data visualizations beyond bar graphs, histograms, and scatterplots.

- Use these notes to get started: [**Unit 4 Notes - Treemaps, Heatmaps, Streamgraphs, and Alluvials**](./Data110_unit5.pdf)
- Use this Quarto document on treemaps, heatmaps, and alluvials:
     - [Heatmaps, Treemaps, and Alluvials](./heatmaps_treemaps_alluvials.qmd)
- Part 2 shows how to create a streamgraph, though this does not publish on rpubs:
     - [Streamgraphs with Babynames](./heatmaps_treemaps_alluvials.qmd)

## Unit 6 - Scatterplots, Correlation, and Linear Models
This unit will explore the relationship between two or more variables and the process of model building.

- Use these notes to get started: [**Unit 6 Notes - Scatterplots, Correlation, and Linear Models**](./Data110_unit6.pdf)
- Use this Quarto document on scatterplots, correlation, and linear models (and interactivity with plotly):
     - [Correlation Scatterplots and Regression](./correlation_scatterplots_and_regression.qmd)

## Unit 7 - Project 1
This week you will complete project 1. You will have to search for and choose a dataset that is appropriate for this project. You will get approval from me to use the dataset, and then you will complete the project and present it to the class. 

## Unit 8 - Continuous Variables in DS Labs and Interactivity with Highcharter
This unit will specifically explore more complex visualizations specifically for continuous variables; we will also learn to incorporate interactivity using the highcharter package

- Use these notes to get started: [**Unit 8 Notes - Continuous Variables with DS Labs and Interactivity with Highcharter**](./Data110_unit8.pdf)
- Use this Quarto document to explore detailed data visualizations using continuous variables and including interactivity:
     - [DS Labs and Highcharter](./DS_Labs_and_Highcharter.rmd)
- You will need the **nations** dataset from the course datasets for your homework assignment.
 
## Unit 9 - Webscraping 
This unit will explore the ethics of webscraping and how to scrape appropriate websites.

- Use these notes to get started: [**Unit 9 Notes - Webscraping and Ethics**](./Data110_unit9.pdf)

- This is an old tutorial on GIS that allows mapping with multiple layers:
     - [GIS Tutorial](./GIS_Tutorial.rmd)
 
## Unit 11 - Data Dashboards Using Tableau
This unit will revisit Tableau Public, but we will dig deeper to create data dashboards.

- Use these notes to get started: [**Unit 11 Notes - Data Dashboards in Tableau**](./Data110_unit11.pdf)
- You will also need to access both the **nations** and **life_exp_long** datasets from the course datasets.

## Unit 12 - Project 2
This week you will complete project 2. You will have to search for and choose a dataset that is appropriate for this project. You will get approval from me to use the dataset, and then you will complete the project and present it to the class. 

## Unit 13 - Shiny Apps and Data for Good
This week you will learn about Shiny Apps. You will also use various media to learn more about using data for good.
